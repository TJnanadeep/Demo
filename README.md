## Sample Python Script

This repository contains a sample Python script (`sample_script.py`) that demonstrates various Python programming concepts.

### Features

The script demonstrates:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: A `Person` class with methods
- **Functions**: Various utility functions for calculations and data processing
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks for robust error management
- **File Operations**: Reading and writing JSON files
- **Data Structures**: Working with lists and dictionaries

### Usage

Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 sample_script.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:

```bash
chmod +x sample_script.py
./sample_script.py
```

### What the Script Does

1. Creates and demonstrates Person objects
2. Performs mathematical calculations (sum and average)
3. Processes data structures
4. Demonstrates error handling
5. Saves and reads data from JSON files

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)
